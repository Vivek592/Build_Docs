-------------------------------------------------

Review changeset and for any things that Git flags as:

"added by them and 'deleted by us'" - these are likely to be moved files that will need to be moved again later and manually merged/checked for differences.

Check that any other 'deleted by us' files do not require changes to be migrated elsewhere.

git commit

-------------------------------------------------
Make any fixes to new XML files for JSP's: (New XML's that should be in the KF/env-install/database/metadata folders)

** Note all B&Q XML's should now sit under BQ/env-install/database/metadata so you should only need to move the ones in KF

For JSP's: (places where a jsp is referenced) - e.g. <set-property name="rawPath"><![CDATA[/common:/customer/block/panels/account/tradeDetails.jsp]]></set-property>

kf-app -> common:
diy-app -> common:

(note the : - this is so SiteBuilder knows to look in the correct context (web-app) - which is kf-storefront)

-------------------------------------------------
For CSS and JS Files referenced in the XML's:

kf-app
diy-app

From - href="/diy-app/css/areas/basket.css"
To - href="/content/${siteBuilderContext.site.id}/css/areas/basket.css"

This will support multiple stores going forward (casto, etc) when they copy the XML's from us for their first sitebuilder load.



tp-app - **This stays as-is**

--------------------------------------------------

Make any other required changes, e.g. modify the buildfile, move new files from KF to BQ if required (XML's)

** Make sure JSP's are moved from storefront.war to kf-storefront.war in KF/Web
(We are no longer using storefront.war) - it should be removed in the near future completely.

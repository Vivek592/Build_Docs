1.Log into lnxs0086

2.Navigate into /app/jboss/apache-tomcat-6.0.35/bin

3.bash shutdown.sh
This will stop the instance for mock

4.bash startup.sh
This will start the instance for mock

5.Verification

Try with this URL : http://lnxs0086:8000/mockws.war/commidea/mockCommideaGatewaySoap?WSDL

If this page loads , then the instance for the mock is up and running .

If this page fails to loads : 

Click the url " http://lnxs0086:8000 "

This must show you the tomcat home page :

Here , search for /mockws.war in the applications . Just Reload the same .

This should load the mock services .
